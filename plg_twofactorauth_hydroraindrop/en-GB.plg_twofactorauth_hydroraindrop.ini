PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_HYDRORAINDROP_INTRO="This feature allows you to use Google Authenticator, or a compatible application such as FreeOTP, for two factor authentication. In addition to your username and password you will also need to provide a six digit security code to be able to login to this site. The security code is rotated every 30 seconds. This provides extra protection against hackers logging in to your account even if they were able to get hold of your password."
